fastRPCA
========

Matlab code for all variants of robust PCA and SPCP. This implements the code from the conference paper "A variational approach to stable principal component pursuit" by Aravkin, Becker, Cevher, Olsen; UAI 2014.

Not only is this code fast, but it is the only code we know of that solves all common stable principal component pursuit (SPCP) variants, including the new variants we introduced in the paper. All these variants are in some sense equivalent, but some of them are easier to solve, and some have parameters that are easier to estimate.  See the [paper for details](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1089)

Authors
--------------
The code was developed by all the authors of the UAI paper, but primary development is due to Stephen Becker and Aleksandr (Sasha) Aravkin (when both were at IBM Research). Further contributions are welcome.
